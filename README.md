# Learn To CODE!
CODE (short for CODE Or DiE trying) is a brand-new programming language, designed to have the most user-friendly and compact syntax imaginable. It is inspired by some of the greatest and most widely-respected languages ever created, such as INTERCAL and PHP. For maximum flexibility, a javascript interpreter is provided, so you can write your own CODE code and run it with just a press of a button.

We also have a [Rust implementation](https://github.com/benwh1/CODE)!
